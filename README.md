# React-Tic-Tac-Toe
Project description:
This project was an assignment to finish a tic-tac-toe game using React. After completing the requirements, 
I went on to update the look of the game using CSS. I also added a reset button above the game for player 
convienence.

How to run:
This program uses React and will run on a local http server.

Roadmap for improvements:
I would like to stop players from clicking more buttons after there has been declared a winner. I would 
also to take away the ability to click on already assigned spaces. As the game works now you can "steal" 
the other player's squares. Also users being able to give the players names would be a fun way to 
personalize the game.
